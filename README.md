# Random-Forest-Model-Support-Vector-Machine
Using Python to build Random Forest and SVM models for a bank customer churn scenario. 

Analyzing a dataset BankChurn.csv which had data
of a bank’s customers and their churn. The descriptions of the columns are given below. Run
both Random Forest and Support Vector Machines models on the data to predict whether a
customer will churn or not (i.e., the target variable is “churn”) and creating a report to show findings.

• credit_score: Customer's credit score.
